# MORSE CODE
Requires the MAKER-PI-PICO board with a buzzer.

The micropython script has a string message hard coded into it, and when the script is run, it will beep out the corresponding morse code for every letter in the message and flash the built in LED too.

The string must be changed in the code to read a different message.
