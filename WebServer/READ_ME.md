# WEB SERVER
The Pi Pico can host a small web page and process requests to turn the LED on, off, and activate challenge 3, RickRoll.

The pico will connect to the hardcoded wifi and is reachable on the local IP address (192.168.0.[NUM]), where the num is decided by the router. After the pico has connected to wifi, it will blink NUM times to let you know what IP to connect to.
